# 3D Model Generation from Text or Image using Shap-E & Depth Estimation

This project allows you to generate **3D models from either a text prompt or a 2D image** using cutting-edge models like [OpenAI's Shap-E](https://github.com/openai/shap-e) and Intel's DPT for depth estimation. The generated models can be visualized using the included `display_model.py`.


## üìÅ Files

* `main.py`: Core script to generate 3D models from either a **text prompt** or an **image**.
* `display_model.py`: Visualizes the `.obj` 3D models generated by `main.py`.


## üöÄ Features

* ‚úÖ Generate 3D mesh from a text prompt using **Shap-E**
* ‚úÖ Estimate depth from image and convert to 3D mesh
* ‚úÖ Uses **Hugging Face Accelerate** for device-aware execution (CPU/GPU, mixed precision)
* ‚úÖ Save model to `.obj` format for easy reuse and visualization


## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-generator.git
   cd 3d-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. *(Optional but recommended)* Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv 3D_Model
   source 3D_Model/bin/activate  # on Linux/Mac
   3D_Model\Scripts\activate     # on Windows
   ```


## üß† Usage

### Generate 3D Model from Text Prompt

```python
from main import text_to_3d_model

text_to_3d_model("a futuristic space car")
```

This will save a 3D model as `output.obj`.


### Generate 3D Model from Image

```python
from main import image_to_3d_model

image_to_3d_model("input.jpg", "output_from_image.obj")
```

Ensure `input.jpg` is a valid image in the working directory.


### Visualize the Model

```bash
python display_model.py output.obj
```

You can also run this inside a Jupyter notebook if you're using a 3D viewer like `trimesh`, `vedo`, or `pythreejs`.


## üì¶ Requirements

These are specified in `requirements.txt`, but key libraries include:

* `diffusers`
* `transformers`
* `trimesh`
* `Pillow`
* `scipy`
* `torch`
* `accelerate`


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

TripoSR was considered for this project but is currently not compatible with this pipeline-based approach. It is primarily designed as an online web application, not a programmatic, local-use library.

The 2D-to-3D models generated using shap-e or intel/dpt-large are basic and not highly detailed. For high-fidelity and photorealistic 3D outputs, more GPU-intensive solutions like TripoSR or DreamFusion are recommended.
